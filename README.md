# dumb_menu
one day i want to make a menu for my progarm, but i don't want to use any library they are so heavy and not support both mac and windows (i am talking about u : simple_term_menu ), so i make this.

dumb_menu is a ligh weight menu ,support hot key, support both win and mac ,not tested on linux.

```python
options = ["[1]Option 1", "[2]Option 2", "[3]Option 3","[q]quit"]
index = get_menu_choice(options)
print(f"You selected option {index + 1}: {options[index]}")
```
